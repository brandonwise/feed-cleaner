## What It Does

Feed Cleaner scores every post on your X timeline across 4 dimensions:

| Detector | What It Catches |
|----------|----------------|
| 🤖 **AI Content** | 24 linguistic patterns, 500+ vocabulary signals, sentence uniformity, readability analysis |
| 🎣 **Engagement Bait** | Shock hooks, rage bait, FOMO triggers, engagement farming, hashtag stuffing |
| 🤖 **Bot/Farm** | Generic replies, suspicious follower ratios, template posts, new account activity |
| 💎 **Originality** | Personal experience, technical depth, vocabulary richness, natural writing rhythm |

Posts get graded A through F with full transparency — click any score to see exactly why.

## Features

- **Three Filter Modes**: Highlight (color-code), Dim (fade low quality), Clean (remove entirely)
- **Quality Threshold Slider**: Set your own standards
- **Gem Detection**: High-quality posts get a 💎 badge so you don't miss them
- **Detail Breakdown**: Click any score for a full analysis with color-coded category bars
- **Session Stats**: Posts scanned, filtered, time saved — right in the popup
- **Account Audit Dashboard**: See your best and worst follows ranked by content quality
- **Share Your Score**: Copy your feed health score and share it

## Privacy

**100% local. Always.**

- All analysis runs in your browser — zero API calls
- We never see your feed, your scores, or your data
- No tracking, no analytics, no telemetry
- No account required

## Detection Engine

The detection engine is adapted from [Humanizer](https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer), extended for social media:

- **Text Statistics**: Flesch-Kincaid readability, burstiness (sentence length variance), type-token ratio
- **Pattern Matching**: 100+ regex patterns across AI vocabulary, bait hooks, bot behaviors
- **Weighted Scoring**: Each detector contributes to a weighted overall score (configurable)
- **Confidence Scaling**: Short texts get lower confidence to avoid false positives
